-For the robot's brain we have decided to use an Arduino MEGA board and a L298N Motor Driver for the traction motor, glued on the chassis of the Robot elevating.

-As a proximity detector, an ultrasonic sensor has been placed on a microservo motor on the front of the Robot.

-A MiniBreadboard has been placed in front of the Arduino MEGA to connect current Jumpers and a OLED 128x64 Display.

-A color sensor has been placed on it to detect traffic signs on the track.

-The proximity sensor has been programmed to detect nearby objects and print their distance on the robot's screen. If the printed distance is less than 40cm, the danger state is activated.
-The ultrasonic sensor sends a wave and it bounces off the obstacle and returns and the sensor receives it, giving us the duration of the wave's trip, the duration is multiplied by the speed of sound and divided by 2 to calculate the distance of the object with the robot.

-Operation of the danger state to stop the robot in front of an obstacle and avoid a collision.
